# Injury-Aware-Game-Design-Tool

Injury-Aware Game Design tool is an iteration of a previous research project, based on the [REU 2021 research project](https://github.com/MarinelTinnirello/REU-2021) under the same name, later published as a paper in [EAI ArtsIT 2021](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-95531-1_8). To see a breakdown of the original project, see this [link](https://marineltinnirello.com/HTML/Work/injuryawaregamedesign.html) on my site.

In this iteration, we plan to update the project to be more modular (adding controller support, analog stick & mouse support), to be redone as an editor scripting tool, to be cross platform between Unity and Unreal, and to be more concise (writing the `.csv` file locally and generating the heat map accordingly into a local folder).
